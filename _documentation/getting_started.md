  #### Overview


  Welcome to the **In**teractive **Co**nsole (Inco) bot, a general-purpose and
  server moderation program for TeamSpeak 3! Before logging issues or support
  requests, please be sure to fully read this documentation.


  #### Download and Setup


  **Download:&nbsp;**<br>A fully functional JAR can be downloaded from our
  project's GitHub releases
  ([here](https://github.com/somefriggnidiot/IncoBot-TS3/releases)) with
  included config templates. Alternatively, you can clone and build the project
  itself.


  **Setup:**<br>Configure the connection and access settings. At minimum, ensure
  each access/permission level has a group, and that your host and login
  information are correct. Ensure the JAR is in the same folder as the `config`
  folder.


  #### Running the Program


  **Windows:&nbsp;**


  **Closing the command prompt in which the bot is running will exit the bot
  program.**

  {: .warning}


  1. Open the folder where you've saved the `incobot-ts3-&lt;version&gt;.tar`
  contents.

  2. In the address bar where the path is shown, click once on it to highlight
  all contents. Type `cmd` and press `enter`; a command prompt window should
  open up to your current location.

  3. In the command prompt window, use the following command as appropriate for
  your IncoBot version: `java -jar incobot-ts3-&lt;version&gt;.jar`


  **Ubuntu:**


  1. Navigate to the location where you saved the contents of the
  `incobot-ts3-&lt;version&gt;.tar` package.

  2. Use `java -jar incobot-ts3-&lt;version&gt;.jar` to run the bot. (We
  recommend using a [Screen](http://aperiodic.net/screen/quick_reference), if you're not already.)
